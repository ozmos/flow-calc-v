# flow-calc-v

## Description
A compact but powerful mobile web application for irrigation design.  It helps irrigation installers calculate the number of sprinkler heads each station can have based on flow rate and pressure.  Flow-calc-v builds on two previous projects: [Flow Calculator](https://github.com/ozmos/flow-calculator), and [Flow Calculator 2.0](https://github.com/ozmos/flow-calculator-2.0), using the [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/) frame work.
